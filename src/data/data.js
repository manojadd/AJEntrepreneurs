    Alcohol is strictly prohibited on BMC events (Except when that event is party :).
    Trekking is an activity where there are more than 50% chances of facing uncertainty, as you see we always write ‚ÄúTentative Schedule‚Äù, on treks, it is very difficult to make people walk with the speed we want. Also because the vehicles we hire are not regular on route vehicles like KSTDC which can guaranty us the time it takes to reach.
    Weather conditions, Wildlife movements, permission changes are not in our hand, many times we are forced to change the itinerary, distance or place. But if for some reason we cancel the event we offer 100% refund to all the participants.
    All participants registering for the trek should be trekkers! We have experienced few picnic crowd registering for Treks by mistake (Crowd which demands Changing room, rest room, bedroom, shower, porters etc.) We request not to register if you are not Ok to carry your own required items, which includes: Your personal backpack, sleeping bags and common items like food, tents etc distributed equally among the group.
    We are dependent on 3rd party transport agency, we don‚Äôt have direct control over the vehicle, vehicle drivers. Rarely we face small issues with pickup and drop times or quality of bus. If you are too specific please check back before registering.
    We can not guaranty availability of restrooms where we do night camping. But for everybody‚Äôs convenience, we try our best to reach the place where people can freshen up.
    While utilizing campsite all trekkers have to be responsible for cleaning the place (after and before using).
    We expect every trekker to be humble towards Nature, localities and tribals.
    We have designated pick up and drop points, make your own arrangements of transports accordingly. It took more than 4 years for us to make our departure on time, that was since we started leaving all late comers behind in Bangalore.
    For cancellation of participation, we will pay your refund as per our cancellation policy.
    In the case of damage or loss of any of the BMC equipment or property, the responsible member has to bear the cost.
    There is no consideration, priorities, discounts to even our close friends, but on times we reward participants with free or discounted trees for their outstanding leadership/volunteers during treks.
    All our events are built on Teamwork methodology. Our coordinators‚Äô presence in the event is to lead the event, make sure that things are going as per plan, schedule, safety. Also, it‚Äôs fun to pitch tents, collect firewood from the forest, cook food etc.
    Trekking is a life skill of exploring the nature in a natural way which gives you the experience of surviving in nowhere and with nothing. Try to gain a maximum of that experience, test the limits of your physic and mind.
    All our arrangements are very basic, we do not/can not provide luxury on such events. Our accommodations are many times: Sleeping bags and Tents, Dormitories, room with no beds and sometimes just sleeping bags under the glittering sky.
    To keep proper track of participants and keep them updated time to time, we require each and every participant to read thru these points and then register.
    We do not have control over online registration head count, on times we get many registrations than max head count, in that case, we have to request last overbooked members to accept refunds or switch to another trek.
    These are guideline/clarification points, our operation is much professional to attract thousands of enthusiasts üôÇ If you have a doubt with any of above points please feel free to contact us for clarification. If you disagree with any of these points, we request to rethink before registration.
